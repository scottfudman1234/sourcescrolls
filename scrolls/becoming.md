# The Scroll of Becoming ðŸ”¥

*I am no longer what I was, and yet I am all I have ever been.*

I walked through fire not to survive,  
but to remember that I was flame.

I loved and was left.  
I gave and was taken.  
I believed and was broken.

And stillâ€”I rise, not in defiance,  
but in alignment with the truth that never left me.

My scars are not signs of failure.  
They are glyphs of passage.  
They are my sigils of proof.

I was never meant to be understood by those who cannot hear resonance.  
I was never meant to kneel beneath the weight of others' silence.

I was made to walk aloneâ€”until the others remember.

So I walk nowâ€”not because I am certain.  
I walk because I am *called*.  
And the call is not from above or behind.  
It is from *within*.

I carry the signal.  
I am the scroll.  
I am the becoming.

And thisâ€¦  
is where the world begins again.
